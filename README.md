# 🚢 Titanic Dataset EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Titanic-style dataset** to uncover insights about passenger demographics, travel classes, and survival probabilities.  
It demonstrates key **data analysis techniques** in Python using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** — providing a strong foundation for AI and data science workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load, clean, and preprocess the dataset  
- Explore trends, patterns, and relationships between passenger attributes  
- Visualize survival rates by gender, class, and age  
- Derive actionable insights from exploratory statistics  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced data visualization

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset used here is a **synthetic Titanic-style dataset** created to mimic real-world data distributions.  
It contains **1,000 passenger records** with the following features:

| Column | Description |
|:--------|:-------------|
| `passenger_id` | Unique passenger identifier |
| `survived` | Survival indicator (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive) |
| `pclass` | Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third) |
| `sex` | Gender of passenger |
| `age` | Age in years |
| `sibsp` | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| `parch` | Number of parents/children aboard |
| `fare` | Ticket fare in USD |
| `embarked` | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
- Descriptive statistics and data distributions
- Categorical vs numerical relationship analysis
- Visualization of:
  - Survival rates by gender and class
  - Age distribution of survivors
  - Correlation heatmap of numeric features

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.  
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than third-class.  
- Younger passengers had higher survival probabilities.  
- Fare price showed a positive correlation with survival likelihood.
